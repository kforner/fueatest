a R package implementing _A fast, unbiased and exact allelic exact test_

This is the implementation in R+C of a new association
test described in **A Fast, Unbiased and Exact Allelic Test for case-control association studies.**
Guedj, Wojcik et al. Human Heredity. 2006. 61: 210-221

It appears that in most cases the classical chi-square test used
for testing for allelic association on genotype data is biased.
Our test is unbiased, exact but fast throught careful optimization.
